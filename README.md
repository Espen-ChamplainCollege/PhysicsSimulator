# PhysicsSimulator

## Getting started

You should have [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss) installed already.

When installing Qt, you should also install Qt Creator. It should be an option in the Qt installer.

Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/Espen-ChamplainCollege/PhysicsSimulator`

Move to the dev branch `git checkout dev`

Create a branch to work on `git checkout -b yourBranchName`

Now if you open Qt Creator, and go to open project, you can open the file `CMakeLists.txt` to load the project in Qt Creator
(There is no "Qt project file", it just lives in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.)

At this point you can work on the project like usual. Remember to `git add (files)` to add your changes anda `git commit -m "message"` to commit them.
